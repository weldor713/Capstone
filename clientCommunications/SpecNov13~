Client was pleased by the progress presented. He informed us that he is in the business of renting goats, so a pastoral, earth-toned look and feel would be most desirable for his website.

He requested tags be displayed horizontally on the main page. He informed us deleting posts would be desirable but not necessesary. He requested that the edit static content field be pre populated with the existant static content.

So it goes.
